Goal

Predict the Expected Value (EV) changes in Blackjack based on card removal patterns from a 6-deck shoe. 
Your model should accurately estimate how removing specific combinations of cards affects the remaining deck's EV, 
providing a machine learning alternative to traditional combinatorial analysis.
